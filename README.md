You can test the execution with the `full.sh` script

## Pre-requesites
Be fure to have gnuplot  and maqao installed as the script uses it

## Usage
* set the variables `WARM` `NB_RUN` `DATA_SIZE` the way you need to in order to test
* if your maqao isn't in usr/local/bin be sure to add its path (line 133 of full.sh)
* your plots would be in meta_plot along with a few csv files, the plots represent the ticks for each iteration of the warmup
* `res.csv` should have average results for each flag
